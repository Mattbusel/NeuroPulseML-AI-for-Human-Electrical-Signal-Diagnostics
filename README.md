 NeuroPulseML ‚Äì AI for Human Electrical Signal Diagnostics
Detect the undetectable. Diagnose the unimaginable.

 Overview
NeuroPulseML is an experimental machine learning framework designed to detect early-stage medical conditions by analyzing the electric signals emitted from the human body. From subtle nervous system anomalies to cardiac arrhythmias and neurodegenerative precursors ‚Äî this model aims to understand what traditional diagnostics miss.

We are building a future where AI listens to your body‚Äôs pulses and flags potential threats before they manifest into symptoms.

 Core Concept
The human body emits electrical pulses as part of nearly all biological functions: thought, movement, heartbeats, pain, sleep. By capturing these via non-invasive sensors and running them through deep learning models, NeuroPulseML attempts to:

Detect irregular patterns before they become symptomatic

Predict future medical conditions using time-series analysis

Provide interpretable insights into neurological and cardiac behavior

 Tech Stack
Signal Acquisition: EEG / EMG / EKG sensors

Preprocessing: FFT, wavelet transforms, denoising autoencoders

ML Model: Transformer-based time series model + anomaly detection module

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly dashboards for signal interpretation

Deployment (Planned): Edge-compatible model with live data ingestion

 Use Cases
Neurodegenerative Diseases ‚Äì Early detection of Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs

Cardiac Events ‚Äì Micro-anomaly detection in heart rhythm

Chronic Fatigue / Fibromyalgia ‚Äì Signal pattern recognition across daily cycles
 Stress Monitoring ‚Äì Real-time physiological tracking for mental health diagnostics

Future Goals
Expand dataset across demographics for model generalization

Integrate federated learning for privacy-preserving diagnostics

Partner with hardware developers for real-time wearables
